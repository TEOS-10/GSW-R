gsw is an R package that provides a connection to software relating to TEOS,
the Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater (see http://www.teos-10.org). This
connection involves R wrappers to C functions within the GSW-C library
(https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C, release v3.06-16-0, commit
657216dd4f5ea079b5f0e021a4163e2d26893371), along with a data file within the
GSW-Matlab library
(https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab/blob/master/Toolbox/library/gsw_data_v3_0.mat,
commit 38c9635d6fd93e74c2648e4ee23cec49c1f58530).

The foundational algorithms upon which both GSW-C and GSW-R rest were devised
by the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research / International Association for
the Physical Sciences of the Oceans, Working Group 127.  These algorithms were
recommended as a replacement for a previous system (called UNESCO-80) at the
twenty-fifth assembly in the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission in
2009.

The gsw functions reproduce test values in the GSW-Fortran documentation to
a tolerance of 1.5e-8, the default for numerical comparison in R working on
a 64-bit machine.  This offers some assurance that the coding process
has not introduced errors.

The naming convention in gsw is patterned on the system described at
http://www.teos-10.org/pubs/gsw/html/gsw_contents.html, as a way to reduce the
effort users might face in switching to R.
