#' @section Bugs:
#' 
#' As of March 27, 2017, the test values listed in \dQuote{Examples} do not match
#' values provided at the TEOS-10 website listed in \dQuote{References},
#' but they match with values given by the Matlab code that is
#' provided on the TEOS-10 website. It is expected that the
#' TEOS-10 website will be updated by May 2017. As those updates to the TEOS-10
#' website become available, the present comment will be revised or deleted.
