Conservative Temperature from Potential Temperature
}
\details{
The present R function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (with source code at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C}), which
in turn is based on the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn is based on the GSW-Matlab system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).
To learn more about these software systems, their authorships, and the science behind
it all, please consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org}.
