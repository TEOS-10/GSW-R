\title{Second Derivatives of Conservative Temperature}
\usage{
gsw_CT_second_derivatives(SA, pt)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{pt}{potential temperature (ITS-90) [ degC ]}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{CT_SA_SA} [ K/(g/kg)^2 ], the second derivative of
Conservative Temperature with respect to Absolute Salinity at constant
potential temperature, and \code{CT_SA_pt} [ 1/(g/kg) ], the derivative of
Conservative Temperature with respect to potential temperature and
Absolute Salinity, and \code{CT_pt_pt} [ 1/degC ], the second derivative of
Conservative Temperature with respect to potential temperature.

\details{
The present R function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (Version 3.05-4 dated 2017-08-07, available at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C},
as git commit '5b4d959e54031f9e972f3e863f63e67fa4f5bfec'), which
stems from the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn stems from the GSW-Matlab system
(\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).

it all.
