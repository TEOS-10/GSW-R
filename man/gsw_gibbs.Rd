\title{Gibbs Energy of Seawater, and its Derivatives}
\usage{
gsw_gibbs(ns, nt, np, SA, t, p = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{ns}{An integer, the order of the \code{SA} derivative. Must be 0, 1, or 2.}

\item{nt}{An integer, the order of the \code{t} derivative. Must be 0, 1, or 2.}

\item{np}{An integer, the order of the \code{p} derivative. Must be 0, 1, or 2.}

\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ].  The valid range for most `gsw`
functions is 0 to 42 g/kg.}

\item{t}{in-situ temperature (ITS-90) [ degC ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}
}
\value{
Gibbs energy [ J/kg ] if \code{ns}=\code{nt}=\code{np}=0. Derivative of energy
with respect to \code{SA} [ J/kg/(g/kg)^ns ] if \code{ns} is nonzero and \code{nt}=\code{np}=0,
etc. Note that derivatives with respect to pressure are in units with Pa, not dbar.

\section{Implementation Note}{


This R function uses a wrapper to a C function contained within the GSW-C
system as updated 2022-10-11 at \url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C} with
git commit `657216dd4f5ea079b5f0e021a4163e2d26893371`.

The C function uses data from the \code{library/gsw_data_v3_0.mat}
file provided in the GSW-Matlab source code, version 3.06-11.
Unfortunately, this version of the mat file is no longer displayed on the
TEOS-10.org website.  Therefore, in the interests of making GSW-R be
self-contained, a copy was downloaded from
\url{http://www.teos-10.org/software/gsw_matlab_v3_06_11.zip} on 2022-05-25,
the .mat file was stored in the developer/create_data directory of
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-R}, and then the dataset used in GSW-R
was created based on that .mat file.

Please consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org} to learn more about the various
TEOS-10 software systems.

\section{Caution}{

The TEOS-10 webpage for \code{gsw_gibbs} does not provide test values, so
the present R version should be considered untested.

\examples{
library(gsw)
p <- seq(0, 100, 1)
SA <- rep(35, length(p))
t <- rep(-5, length(p))
## Check the derivative wrt pressure. Note the unit change
E <- gsw_gibbs(0, 0, 0, SA, t, p)
# Estimate derivative from linear fit (try plotting: it is very linear)
m <- lm(E ~ p)
print(summary(m))
plot(p, E)
abline(m)
dEdp1 <- coef(m)[2]
# Calculate derivative ... note we multiply by 1e4 to get from 1/Pa to 1/dbar
dEdp2 <- 1e4 * gsw_gibbs(0, 0, 1, SA[1], t[1], p[1])
## Ratio
dEdp1 / dEdp2
