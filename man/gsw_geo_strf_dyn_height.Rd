\title{Geostrophic Dynamic Height Anomaly}
\usage{
gsw_geo_strf_dyn_height(SA, CT, p, p_ref = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{CT}{Conservative Temperature [ degC ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}

\item{p_ref}{reference pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}
}
\value{
A vector containing geopotential anomaly in
\eqn{m^2/s^2}{m^2/s^2} for each level. For more on the units, see [2].
}
\description{
This calculates a geopotential anomaly, called either the
dynamic height anomaly or the geostrophic streamfunction
in the TEOS-10 document listed as [1] below; users should
read that and the references therein for more details on
the definition and its calculation here.

To get the column-integrated value in meters, take the first
value of the returned vector and divide by
9.7963\eqn{m/s^2}{m/s^2}. Note that this yields an integral
with the top measured pressure (not zero) as an upper limit.
}
\details{
Because of the scheme used in the underlying C code, the
pressures must be in order, and must not have any repeats.
Also, there must be at least 4 pressure values. Violating
any of these three restrictions yields an error.

If \code{p_ref} exceeds the largest \code{p} value, a vector
of zeros is returned, in accordance with the underlying C code.

Note the alteration of the test-value tolerance from a much smaller
default. This is required because the test values derive from the
GSW-Matlab code, which uses a different interpolation scheme than
the GSW-C code, upon which GSW-R relies.  See References 2 and 3 for
more on this topic.

\section{Implementation Note}{


This R function uses a wrapper to a C function contained within the GSW-C
system as updated 2021-12-28 at \url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C} with
git commit `98f0fd40dd9ceb0ba82c9d47ac750e935a7d0459`.

The C function uses data from the \code{library/gsw_data_v3_0.mat}
file provided in the GSW-Matlab source code, version 3.06-11.
Unfortunately, this version of the mat file is no longer displayed on the
TEOS-10.org website.  Therefore, in the interests of making GSW-R be
self-contained, a copy was downloaded from
\url{http://www.teos-10.org/software/gsw_matlab_v3_06_11.zip} on 2022-05-25,
the .mat file was stored in the developer/create_data directory of
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-R}, and then the dataset used in GSW-R
was created based on that .mat file.

Please consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org} to learn more about the various
TEOS-10 software systems.
