\title{Seawater Spiciness at p=2000 dbar}
\usage{
gsw_spiciness2(SA, CT)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{CT}{Conservative Temperature [ deg C ]}
}
\value{
spiciness [ kg/m^3 ]
}
\description{
Calculate seawater spiciness referenced to 2000 dbar.
}
\details{
The present function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (with sourcecode at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C}), which
in turn is based on the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn is based on the GSW-Matlab system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).

it all, consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org}.
