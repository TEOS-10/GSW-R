\title{Calculate Brunt Vaisala Frequency squared}
\usage{
gsw_Nsquared(SA, CT, p, latitude = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{CT}{Conservative Temperature [ degC ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}

\item{latitude}{latitude in decimal degrees, positive to the north of the equator. (This
is called \code{lat} in the TEOS-10 Matlab code.)}
}
\value{
list containing N2 [ 1/s^ ] and mid-point pressure p_mid [ dbar ]
}
\description{
The result is computed based on first-differencing a computed density with
respect pressure, and this can yield noisy results with CTD data that
have not been smoothed and decimated. It also yields infinite values,
for repeated adjacent pressure (e.g. this occurs twice with the \code{ctd}
dataset provided in the \CRANpkg{oce} package).

\details{
The present R function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (Version 3.05-4 dated 2017-08-07, available at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C},
as git commit '5b4d959e54031f9e972f3e863f63e67fa4f5bfec'), which
stems from the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn stems from the GSW-Matlab system
(\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).

it all.
