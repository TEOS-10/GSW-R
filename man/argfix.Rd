\title{Reshape list elements to match the shape of the first element.}
\usage{
argfix(list)
}
\arguments{
\item{list}{A list of elements, typically arguments that will be used in GSW functions.}
}
\value{
A list with all elements of same shape (length or dimension).
}
\description{
This is mainly used within gsw, to ensure that arguments sent
to the C functions are of equal length.  This is a convenience, 
for processing data that often have this condition. For example, a
CTD profile is likely to have many values for SP, t, and p,
but just a single value for each of longitude and latitude.
It is important to call argfix() to handle such cases, because
otherwise the underlying C code will be looking past the end of
the vectors storing longitude and latitude, which can yield odd
results or even segmentation faults.
