\title{Compute Absolute Salinity at Freezing Point (Polynomial version)}
\usage{
gsw_SA_freezing_from_CT_poly(CT, p, saturation_fraction)
}
\arguments{
\item{CT}{Conservative Temperature [ degC ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}

\item{saturation_fraction}{fraction of air in water [unitless]}
}
\value{
Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]
}
\description{
Compute Absolute Salinity at Freezing Point (Polynomial version)
}
\details{
The present R function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (with source code at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C}), which
in turn is based on the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn is based on the GSW-Matlab system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).
To learn more about these software systems, their authorships, and the science behind
it all, please consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org}.
