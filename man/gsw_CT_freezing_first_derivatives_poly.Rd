\title{First Derivatives of Conservative Temperature for Freezing Water (Polynomial version)}
\usage{
gsw_CT_freezing_first_derivatives_poly(SA, p, saturation_fraction = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}

\item{saturation_fraction}{fraction of air in water [unitless]}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{CTfreezing_SA} [ K/(g/kg) ], the derivative of
Conservative Temperature with respect to Absolute Salinity at constant
potential temperature, and \code{CTfreezing_p} [ unitless], the derivative of
Conservative Temperature with respect to pressure at constant
Absolute Salinity.

\section{Implementation Note}{


This R function uses a wrapper to a C function contained within the GSW-C
system as updated 2021-12-28 at \url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C} with
git commit `98f0fd40dd9ceb0ba82c9d47ac750e935a7d0459`.

The C function uses data from the \code{library/gsw_data_v3_0.mat}
file provided in the GSW-Matlab source code, version 3.06-11.
Unfortunately, this version of the mat file is no longer displayed on the
TEOS-10.org website.  Therefore, in the interests of making GSW-R be
self-contained, a copy was downloaded from
\url{http://www.teos-10.org/software/gsw_matlab_v3_06_11.zip} on 2022-05-25,
the .mat file was stored in the developer/create_data directory of
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-R}, and then the dataset used in GSW-R
was created based on that .mat file.

Please consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org} to learn more about the various
TEOS-10 software systems.
