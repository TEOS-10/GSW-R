\title{Sound speed}
\usage{
gsw_sound_speed(SA, CT, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{CT}{Conservative Temperature [ deg C ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [dbar], i.e. absolute pressure [dbar] minus 10.1325 dbar}
}
\value{
sound speed [ m/s ]
}
\description{
Speed of sound in seawater, using the 75-term equation for specific volume.
}
\details{
The present R function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (with source code at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C}), which
in turn is based on the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn is based on the GSW-Matlab system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).
To learn more about these software systems, their authorships, and the science behind
it all, please consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org}.
