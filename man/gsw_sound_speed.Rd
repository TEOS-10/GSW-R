\title{Sound speed}
\usage{
gsw_sound_speed(SA, CT, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{SA}{Absolute Salinity [ g/kg ]}

\item{CT}{Conservative Temperature [ deg C ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [ dbar ]}
}
\value{
sound speed [ m/s ]
}
\description{
Speed of sound in seawater, using the 75-term equation for specific volume.
}
\details{
The present function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (with sourcecode at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C}), which
in turn is based on the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn is based on the GSW-Matlab system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).

it all, consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org}.
