\title{Electrical conductivity from Practical Salinity}
\usage{
gsw_C_from_SP(SP, t, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{SP}{Practical Salinity (PSS-78) [ unitless ]}

\item{t}{in-situ temperature (ITS-90) [ deg C ]}

\item{p}{sea pressure [ dbar ]}
}
\value{
electrical conductivity [ mS/cm ]
}
\description{
Electrical conductivity (in mS/cm) from Practical Salinity.
To convert the return value to conductivity ratio,
divide by 42.9140 (the value of conductivity at S=35, T68=15, and
p=0).
}
\details{
The present function works with a wrapper to a C function contained
within the GSW-C system (with sourcecode at
\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-C}), which
in turn is based on the GSW-Fortran system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Fortran})
which in turn is based on the GSW-Matlab system (\url{https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-Matlab}).

it all, consult \url{http://www.teos-10.org}.
